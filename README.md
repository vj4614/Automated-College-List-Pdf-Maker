‚öôÔ∏è Input File Structure (Excel)
The tool expects the Excel data to be structured in blocks. Each block represents one student's report.
Student Profile: The first 8 rows of a block should contain the student's profile information.
Column A (or as specified in settings): Profile field label (e.g., "Name", "Percentile").
Column B (or as specified in settings): Profile field value.
College List: Starting from row 10 of a block.
Column A (or as specified in settings): College Code.
Column B (or as specified in settings): College Name.
Column C (or as specified in settings): Branch Name.
The tool identifies a new student block whenever it encounters a row where the profile label column contains the text "Name".
