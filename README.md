## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Input File Requirements

For the tool to work correctly, your Excel files must follow a specific structure.

### 1. Excel File Structure

The tool processes data in blocks, where each block represents one student's report.

* **Student Profile Block**: The first 8 rows of a block must contain the student's profile information.
    * The first column (e.g., `A`) should have the profile field label (e.g., "Name", "Percentile").
    * The second column (e.g., `B`) should have the corresponding value.
* **College List Block**: This section starts from row 10 and contains the list of colleges for that student. The columns must match the mappings you define in the advanced options.
* **Student Separator**: A new student block begins whenever the tool finds the text `Name` in the profile label column.

### 2. Advanced Options

The "Advanced Options" section allows you to customize how the tool reads your Excel files.
